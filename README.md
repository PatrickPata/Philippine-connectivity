# Philippine-connectivity

These files contain data on Philippine coral reef connectivity as part of Patrick Pata's Thesis.

The folder Connectivity_XYZ_array_lists contains connectivity data in comma-separated format with each column representing:
- (1) source reef ID
- (2) sink reef ID
- (3) probability of connection

Each of the 36 data files are named according to larval type, simulation year, and simulation months i.e., "xyzlist_[larvaltype]_[year]_[months].csv".

The location of the reef IDs are stored in the files PH_reef_centroids_3776.csv for centroids and PH_reef_polygons_3776.wkt for polygons.

For inquiries regarding the dataset please contact ppata@msi.upd.edu.ph.
